Git was created for use in the development of the [[Linux kernel]] by [[Linus Torvalds]] and others developing the kernel.<ref name="pro-git-1.2">{{cite book |chapter-url = https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-A-Short-History-of-Git |chapter = A Short History of Git |title = Pro Git |publisher = Apress |access-date = 26 December 2015 |date = 2014 |edition = 2nd |url = https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225223054/http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 |archive-date = 25 December 2015}}</ref> 

As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most [[client–server]] systems, Git maintains a local copy of the entire [[Repository (version control)|repository]], a.k.a. repo, with history and version-tracking abilities, independent of [[Computer network|network]] access or a central [[Server (computing)|server]]. A repo is stored on each computer in a standard [[directory (computing)|directory]] with additional, hidden files to provide version control capabilities.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Chacon |first1 = Scott |title = Pro Git |date = 24 December 2014 |publisher = [[Apress]] |location = New York, NY |isbn = 978-1-4842-0077-3 |pages = 29–30 |edition = 2nd |url = https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225223054/http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 |archive-date = 25 December 2015}}</ref> Git provides features to [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronize]] changes between repos that share history; copied (cloned) from each other. For collaboration, Git supports synchronizing with repos on [[Computer network|remote]] machines. Although all repos (with the same history) are peers, developers often use a central server to host a repo to hold an integrated copy. 

Git is a [[free and open-source software]] shared under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL-2.0-only license]].

The trademark "Git" is registered by the [[Software Freedom Conservancy]], marking its official recognition and continued evolution in the [[open-source]] community. 

Today, Git is the [[de facto standard]] version control system. It is the most popular distributed version control system, with nearly 95% of developers reporting it as their primary version control system as of 2022.<ref name=":1" /> It is the most widely used source-code management tool among professional developers. There are offerings of Git repository services, including [[GitHub]], [[SourceForge]], [[Bitbucket]] and [[GitLab]].<ref name="Krill 2016">{{cite web |last=Krill |first=Paul |date=28 September 2016 |title=Enterprise repo wars: GitHub vs. GitLab vs. Bitbucket |url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3123244/enterprise-repo-wars-github-vs-gitlab-vs-bitbucket.html |access-date=2 February 2020 |website=InfoWorld}}</ref><ref name="Alexa github.com" /><ref name="Alexa sourceforge.net" /><ref name="Alexa bitbucket.org" /><ref name="Alexa gitlab.com" />
